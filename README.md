# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
In this project the idea was to create a machine learning model to predict the loan status of future borrowers. We are trying to see if they are going to be healthy loans or high-risk loans before we give them out based on the loan status outcome from our data of previous borrowers.

## Code Source
The code sources that I used were primarily from past class activities and practice from module 20. With the code provided in these activities I was able to complete this challenge.

## File Location
To find the notebook where the machine learning model was created and tested you can click on the [credit_risk_classification.ipynb](Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb) file under the Credit_Risk directory to view this. To read the analysis on the results of the machine learning model you can click on the [model_analysis.md](Credit_Risk/model_analysis.md) file under the Credit_Risk directory to view this. Data sources can be found under the Resources tab.
